# Facial Recognition on a Uniform-Appearance Crowd
## Introduction
Facial recognition is a widely used technology in the modern world. It is used in our daily lives whenever we use our mobile devices. In the Western world recognition systems world well because individuals dress differently which assists in finding distinguishing features for classification. In the Middle East uniform-crowd appearance is a great challenge. We have used available systems and state of the art technologies to find a solution to this problem.

## Problem Statement
Person detection and identification have numerous applications in surveillance, human-computer interaction, and security. Performing this task in a uniform-appearance crowd, often encountered in the Middle East and the gulf-region is a challenge. Up to now, there is no such system that can handle such a task effectively. A proposed solution is to use a camera-equipped drone-based system. This system is invasive, having a nearly zero risk of collision, and most importantly has more flexibility in tracking when it comes to a computer vision-based system. The scope of this project is to develop, implement and validate a deep learning vision model for the proposed solution.

## Solution
First, the dataset must be prepared. To get the dataset ready, the class had scheduled multiple sessions, where numerous videos of us wearing uniform clothes and walking as a crowd were recorded. After the dataset was ready, each team member had to choose at least one video with different challenges and annotate himself. Then, the team had to look up libraries and algorithms on face detection and face recognition. After the face detection and recognition is done, the team must validate, analyze, and compare the results gotten from the different challenges.
